def get_gender_prompt(author_firstname, author_lastname):
    return f"""Given the name of the author, please identify the likely gender of the author.
    Consider the following instructions:

    - Provide the gender as either "male", "female", "other", or "not retrievable".
    - Include a reasoning for each author based on the name provided.
    - For composed names (e.g., "Jose Mar√≠a", "Emma Charles"), consider the combined meaning, as such names may indicate gender differently than their individual parts would suggest.

    The first name of the author is: {author_firstname}.
    The last name of the author is: {author_lastname}.
   
    Please return the response in **strict JSON format only**, with no additional text.
    Use the following structure:
    {{
        "author": {{
            "first_name": "{author_firstname}",
            "last_name": "{author_lastname}",
